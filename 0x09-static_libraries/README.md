Static libraries
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Holberton School. It aims to learn about static libraries in C language.

Technologies
Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
C files are written according to the C90 standard
Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

Filename	Description
libholberton.a	Static library that contains a lot of functions
create_static_lib.sh	Script that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory
holberton.h	Header file that contains all the prototypes of the used functions
C - Static libraries

TASKS

[0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life](libmy.a)

Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions listed below:

If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones with the right prototype.

Don’t forget to push your main.h file to your repository. It should at least contain all the prototypes of the above functions.

[1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future](create_static_lib.sh)

Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
